This is a bootcamp challenge project meant to exercise use of MongoDB, Mongoose, GraphQL, and API calls, specifically to Google's Book API. A user can search for books, and when signed in to their account, can save books to view later. Data is persisted between sessions using Mongo.

## Instructions
No installation is necessary to use. Click on this link to visit the site: [https://book-search-engine-n8oi.onrender.com](https://book-search-engine-n8oi.onrender.com)

## Usage
Search for a book, and when signed in (top right corner), save a book to view it. A book can be removed from your collection by clicking "remove" on its card.

## Contributing
Fork the project or send me an email!

## Tests
No testing necessary, other than searching for whichever book you want. Google's book search API seems to be robust and shouldn't present issues.
